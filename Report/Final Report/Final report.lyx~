\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some very interesting characteristics of crystals can be analyzed experimentally.
 Such characteristics are the resistivity of a crystal as a function of
 temperature, the hall voltage (this potential difference created by the
 separation of charges in the crystal when a magnetic field is applied on
 the crystal) as a function of temperature and how the intensity of the
 magnetic field affects the resistance of the crystal.
 In this experiment we will choose the germanium semiconductor as our crystal
 to analyze.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to do analyze this characteristics we need to understand the theory
 behind them.
 The resistance of semiconductors like germanium is dependent on temperature.
 Indeed when negative carriers with density 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and charge 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

for each charge, the current density 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{J}$
\end_inset

 relates to the mean velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{v}$
\end_inset

 of the charge carriers by : 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{J}=en\textbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 It also relates to the conductivity 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\nicefrac{1}{\rho}$
\end_inset

 by the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{J}=\sigma\textbf{E}$
\end_inset

.
 For semiconductors it can be shown that the mean velocity is approximately
 equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{v}\approx\frac{e\lambda\textbf{E}}{2\sqrt{3kTm}}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the mean free path of the carriers, k is he Boltzmann constant, T is
 the temperature of the sample and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the effective carrier mass.
 Using this relation and the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 goes like 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{kT}$
\end_inset

 we find that the resistance
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is related to the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 in a way that 
\begin_inset Formula $R\propto T^{b}$
\end_inset

.
 (

) However equation this equation is valid only if the number of carriers
 remains constant.
 The electrons in the semiconductor have access to different levels of energy.
 In semiconductors, these levels are grouped in bands: The Conduction Band
 and the Valence Band.
 For insulators electrons are in the Valence Band, the energy gap between
 Conduction and Valence Band is large and leaves no possibility for electrons
 to move around.
 In semiconductors, the energy band gap is much smaller and the majority
 of the electrons will be in the valence band but some will reach the conduction
 band and be charge carriers.
 At higher temperatures, we reach the limit where the carrier density varies
 with temperature.
 In this case the conductivity follows Maxwell distribution with an exponential
 
\begin_inset Formula $R\propto e^{\nicefrac{a}{T}}$
\end_inset

.
 To conduct an experiment that would show this result we use a sample of
 germanium (
\color red
Figure ....
\color inherit
) connected to a thermocouple that measures the temperature of the crystal.
 The sample is cooled down with liquid nitrogen to approximately 150K.
 The temperature increase to room temperature and then a Dc power supply
 is used to power a heated connected to the sample to increase the temperature
 up to 383K.
 During the entire process a current source supply a constant current of
 1mA to the crystal allowing us to measure different voltages (
\color red
Figure ......
\color inherit
).
 A digital multimeter (DMM) reads the different voltages of interest for
 the experiment and reads the temperature and current through the sample.
 These values are displayed on the apparatus and can be seen on a computer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before introducing next characteristic we are interested in the experiment,
 a common physical quantity, the mobility 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 of the charge carriers, is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=\frac{\textbf{v}}{\textbf{E}}=\frac{\sigma}{ne}$
\end_inset

.
 When a magnetic field is applied while current is driven through the sample,
 a force is induced separating the carriers in such a way that a potential
 difference is created across the sides of the sample.
 This potential is called the Hall Voltage 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{H}$
\end_inset

.
 This effect can also be quantified by the Hall coefficient defined to be
 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{H}=\frac{E_{y}}{J_{x}B}=\frac{V_{H}d}{IB}=\frac{1}{ne}$
\end_inset

, where
\begin_inset Formula $E_{y}$
\end_inset

 is the magnitude of the electric field created by the charge pile-up ,
 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{x}$
\end_inset

is the current density in the sample, B is the magnitude of the magnetic
 field and d is the thickness of the sample (for a rectangle model perpendicular
 to the field).
 Another way to quantify the effect is the Hall angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{H}=\frac{V_{y}}{V_{x}}=\frac{E_{y}w}{E_{x}l}=\frac{w}{l}\mu_{H}B$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{x}$
\end_inset

 is the Hall voltage drop across a width 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 on the sample, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{y}$
\end_inset

 is the voltage drop across a length 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 on the sample.
 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{y}$
\end_inset

 are the corresponding electric fields and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{H}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the mobility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a semiconductor the charge carriers can be negative carriers (carrier
 density 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

) or positive carriers (carrier density 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

).
 The force induced by the magnetic field, thus, push them in opposite direction
 along a 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

direction according to the sign of the carriers.
 Realizing that the net current must be zero and using the previous definition
 we can obtain an equation for the Hall coefficient in terms of the mobilities
 and the carriers densities: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{H}=\frac{\mu_{+}^{2}p-\mu_{-}^{2}n}{e(\mu_{+}p-\mu_{-}n)}
\]

\end_inset

These mobilities very with temperature.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $p>n$
\end_inset

 we expect 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{H}$
\end_inset

 to change sign at some temperature (as 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

increases and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 decreases with increasing temperature).
 Such semiconductors are said to be 
\begin_inset Formula $p-type$
\end_inset

.
 Semiconductors which has 
\begin_inset Formula $n>p$
\end_inset

 are said to be 
\begin_inset Formula $n-type$
\end_inset

Function of conductance against temperature 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A graph of resistance against temperature was done when the voltage V5 (
\color red
Reference to graph of voltages
\color inherit
 ) is applied to the sample and another one when the voltage V6 is applied
 
\color red
(Refer to graph in the appendix
\color inherit
).
 At low temperature when the conduction is mainly due to extrinsic process
 the number of carriers is constant and we expect it to follow a power law
 
\begin_inset Formula $R\propto T^{b}$
\end_inset

 (as discussed in the introduction).
 At high temperature, the carrier density varies with temperature and the
 electrical conductivity follow Maxwell distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $R\propto e^{\nicefrac{a}{T}}$
\end_inset

.
 For both V5 and V6 we fitted the graph of resistance versus temperature
 in the low temperature region with a power law equation 
\begin_inset Formula $a\times(x-x_{0})^{3/2}$
\end_inset

 , where the parameters are 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

 (the value of these parameters are not relevant for the rest of the experiment
 so we will just report the chi square).
 Also we fitted the graph in a high temperature region with a exponential
 decay equation 
\begin_inset Formula $a\times e^{bx}$
\end_inset

, where the parameters are 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The chi square for the power fit was found to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{V_{5}}^{2}=0.82$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{5}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{V6}^{2}=0.85$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{6}$
\end_inset

 (

 The parameters for the exponential fit were found to be for 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{5}$
\end_inset

 : 
\begin_inset Formula $a=2.5(3)\times10^{-4}$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $b=4.54(5)\times10^{3}$
\end_inset

 and the chi square is 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{V_{5}}^{2}=1.07$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{V_{6}}^{2}=1.03$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conductance now is just the inverse of the resistance 
\begin_inset Formula $G=\frac{1}{R}\propto\frac{1}{\rho}$
\end_inset

.
 The graph of the conductance will just appear to be the inverse of the
 graph of the resistance versus temperature.

Therefore the to fit equations are the inverse of the equations used to
 fit the low and high temperature region of the graphs of resistance versus
 temperature.
 In the low temperature region we used 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{a\times(x-x_{0})^{3/2}}$
\end_inset

 ones.
 Similarly in the high temperature region
