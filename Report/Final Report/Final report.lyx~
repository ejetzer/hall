Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some very interesting characteristics of crystals can be analyzed experimentally.
 Such characteristics are the resistivity of a crystal as a function of
 temperature, the hall voltage (this potential difference created by the
 separation of charges in the crystal when a magnetic field is applied on
 the crystal) as a function of temperature and how the intensity of the
 magnetic field affects the resistance of the crystal.
 In this experiment we will choose thevgermanium semiconductor as our crystal
 to analyze.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to do analyze this characteristics we need to understand the theory
 behind them.
 The resistance of semiconductors like germanium is dependent on temperature.
 Indeed when negative carriers with density 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and charge 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

for each charge, the currenty density 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{J}$
\end_inset

 relates to the mean velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{v}$
\end_inset

 of the cahrge carriers by : 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{J}=en\textbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 It also relates to the conductivity 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\nicefrac{1}{\rho}$
\end_inset

 by the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{J}=\sigma\textbf{E}$
\end_inset

.
 For semiconductors it can be shown that the mean velocity is approximately
 equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{v}\approx\frac{e\lambda\textbf{E}}{2\sqrt{3kTm}}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the mean free path of the carriers, k is he Boltzmann constant, T is
 the temperature of the sample and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the effective carrier mass.
 Using this relation and the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 goes like 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{kT}$
\end_inset

 we find that the resistance
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is related to the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 in a way that 
\begin_inset Formula $R\propto T^{b}$
\end_inset

.
 (

) However equation this equation is valid only if the number of carriers
 remains constant.
 The electrons in the semiconductor have access to different levels of energy.
 In semiconductors, these levels are grouped in bands: The Conduction Band
 and the Valence Band.
 For insulators electrons are in the Valence Band, the energy gap between
 Conduction and Valence Band is large and leaves no possibility for electrons
 to move around.
 In semiconductors, the energy band gap is much smaller and the majority
 of the electrons will be in the valence band but some will reach the conduction
 band and be charge carriers.
 At higher temperatures, we reach the limit where the carrier density varies
 with temperature.
 In this case the conductivity follows Maxwell distribution with an exponential
 
\begin_inset Formula $R\propto e^{\nicefrac{a}{T}}$
\end_inset

.
 To conduct an experiment that would show this result we use a sample of
 germanium (
\color red
Figure ....
\color inherit
) connected to a thermocouple that measures the temperature of the crystal.
 The sample is cooled down with liquid nitrogen to approximately 150K.
 The temperature increase to room temperature and then a Dc power supply
 is used to power a heated connected to the sample to increase the temperature
 up to 383K.
 During the entire process a current source supply a constant current of
 1mA to the crystal allowing us to measure different voltages (
\color red
Figure ......
\color inherit
).
 A digital multimeter (DMM) reads the different voltages of interest for
 the experiment and reads the temperature and current through the sample.
 These values are displayed on the apparatus and can be seen on a computer.
 Before introducting next characteristic we are interested in the experiment,
 a common physical quantity, the moblility 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 of the charge carriers, is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=\frac{\textbf{v}}{\textbf{E}}=\frac{\sigma}{ne}$
