\begin_layout Abstract
In this report we go over how we fit a power and exponential functions to
 the resistance of a germanium sample at different temperatures (from 140K
 to 390K).
 The two fits, 
\begin_inset Formula $0.00554(4)\Omega\mathrm{K}^{-3/2}\times(T-120(1)\mathrm{K})^{3/2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $12660(20)\Omega\times e^{(-0.026360(3)\mathrm{K}^{-1}T)}$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $2.1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $7656$
\end_inset

, will allow us to compute the band gap of the germanium sample in a further
 experiment.
 The exponential fit to the high temperature region of the resistance is
 not reliable and further error analysis is required.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resistance of semiconductors like germanium is dependant on temperature.
 For negative charge carriers with density 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and charge 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 for each charge, the current density related to the mean velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{v}$
\end_inset

 of the charge carriers by: 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{J}=en\textbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For semiconductors the mean velocity is approximated to be: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\textbf{v}\approx\frac{e\lambda\textbf{E}}{2\sqrt{3kT\times m}},\label{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the mean free path of the carriers, k is he Boltzmann constant, T is
 the temperature of the sample and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the effective carrier mass.
 Using Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "2"

\end_inset

 and the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 goes like 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{kT}$
\end_inset

 we find that the resistance
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is related to the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R=a\cdot T^{b}\label{3}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "3"

\end_inset

 is valid only if the number of carriers remains constant.
 The electrons in the semiconductor have access to different levels of energy.
 In semiconductors, these levels are grouped in bands: The Conduction Band
 and the Valence Band.
 For insulators electrons are in the Valence Band, the energy gap between
 Conduction and Valence Band is large and leaves no possibility for electrons
 to move around.
 In semiconductors, the energy band gap is much smaller and the majority
 of the electrons will be in the valence band but some will reach the conduction
 band and be charge carriers.
 At higher temperatures, we reach the limit where the carrier density varies
 with temperature.
 In this case the conductivity follows Maxwell distribution with an exponential.
 This experiment is a step towards measuring the band gap of germanium.

Function of resistance against temperature 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To measure the resistance against the temperature, we will use the setup
 displayed in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 A germanium sample is held in a thermos initially filled with liquid nitrogen.
 It is connected to a thermocouple, in turn plugged into a cold-junction
 compensator, and a digital voltmeter connected to a computer.
 The thermocouple allows us to measure the temperature of the sample, and
 the voltmeter gives the potential across the different junctions illustrated
 in Fig.

 give the same result.
 In practice, systematic error due to the shape of the sample may make them
 different.

\begin_layout Standard
To run the experiment, we turned on the current source at a constant 

\begin_inset Formula $I_{fixed}=100\mathrm{mA}$
\end_inset


\lang english
, thermocouple, and multimeter.
 We cooled down the germanium sample with liquid nitrogen until the temperature
 stabilized, around 

\begin_inset Formula $140\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset


\lang english
.
 During the experiment, we made sure the nitrogen could evaporate from the
 thermos, otherwise the sample wouldn't warm back up to room temperature
 in any reasonable time.
 We did this by taking a paper towel to brush off the ice forming around
 the thermos.
 We used 

\begin_inset Formula $\texttt{hall}$
\end_inset


\lang english
 to check on the temperature.
 Once the temperature had stabilized, we restarted

\begin_inset Formula $\texttt{hall}$
\end_inset


\lang english
 to get a data file with only the data we needed.
 When the temperature had reached 

\begin_inset Formula $250\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset


\lang english
, we turned on the heater with a low potential to help bring the sample
 up to

\begin_inset Formula $400\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset


\lang english
.
 We raised the heater voltage each time the temperature stabilized again.
 Once the heater's power source had been set to its maximal output and an
 equilibrium had been reached, we turned off the current source, thermocouple,
 multimeter and heater.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate the error on the measurements, we took another series of potential
 measurements at room temperature, and one with the heater on at equilibrium.
 The standard deviation of the potential at those temperature was then be
 used as the error for low and high temperatures, respectively.
 This gave a statistical uncertainty of 

\begin_inset Formula $0.005\mathrm{V}$
\end_inset


\lang english
 for low temperatures, and 

\begin_inset Formula $0.00002\mathrm{V}$
\end_inset


\lang english
 for high temperatures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Plotting potential against temperature gave us vaguely bell shaped curves,
 as shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:shape"

\end_inset

.
 We fit a power function of the form 

\begin_inset Formula $a(x-x_{0})^{3/2}$
\end_inset


\lang english
 to the left side, and an exponential function 
\begin_inset Formula $ae^{bx}$
\end_inset

 to the right side.
 The results for resistance 

\begin_inset Formula $R=V/I_{fixed}$
\end_inset


\lang english
 against temperature on 

\begin_inset Formula $V_{6}$
\end_inset


\lang english
 are shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:fits"

\end_inset

.
 The obtained functions are 

\begin_inset Formula $0.00554(4)\Omega\mathrm{K}^{-3/2}\times(T-120(1)\mathrm{K})^{3/2}$
\end_inset


\lang english
 and 

\begin_inset Formula $12660(20)\Omega\times\exp(-0.026360(3)\mathrm{K}^{-1}T)$
\end_inset


\lang english
, with 

\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset


\lang english
 of 

\begin_inset Formula $2.1$
\end_inset


\lang english
 and 

\begin_inset Formula $7656$
\end_inset

 
\lang english
respectively.
 The power fit is good and can be used for the further parts fo the experiment.
 The exponential fit is not reliable, considering its large

\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset


\lang english
, and the error analysis on it should be reviewed before we move on.
