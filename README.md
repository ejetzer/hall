# Hall Effect Experiment

- `Data` is where we will put all of the raw data
- `Graphs` is where the figures go
- `Manual`is where we look for theâ€¦ manual
- `Outline`is where we look for what has to be done, and by whom
- `References` is where we collect a bunch of all the references we use during the lab
- `Report` is for the LyX and LaTeX files, as well as the pdfs.
