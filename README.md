# Hall Effect Experiment

- `Data` is where we will put all of the raw data
- `Graphs` is where the figures go
- `Manual`is where we look for theâ€¦ manual
- `Outline`is where we look for what has to be done, and by whom
- `References` is where we collect a bunch of all the references we use during the lab
- `Report` is for the LyX and LaTeX files, as well as the pdfs.
- `Programs` is for the analysis code we'll make. Let's put it all in the same place!

Note: the `Outline/Lab Outline.ipynb` file is an iPython notebook that can be opened using the iPython Notebook app from the Anaconda launcher. It can also technically be read by anything that handles Jupyter notebooks. We'll put things in it like *everything we have to do* and code snippets, and links and stuff. Feel free to edit.

Error : Don't take errors from the computer program. Take a single voltage value and measure it a couple of times and find the standard deviation. try it maybe for another voltage and then use it as the error.
