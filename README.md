# Hall Effect Experiment

## File structure

- `Data` is where we will put all of the raw data
- `Graphs` is where the figures go
- `Manual`is where we look for theâ€¦ manual
- `Outline`is where we look for what has to be done, and by whom
- `References` is where we collect a bunch of all the references we use during the lab
- `Report` is for the LyX and LaTeX files, as well as the pdfs.
- `Programs` is for the analysis code we'll make. Let's put it all in the same place!

Note: the `Outline/Lab Outline.ipynb` file is an iPython notebook that can be opened using the iPython Notebook app from the Anaconda launcher. It can also technically be read by anything that handles Jupyter notebooks. We'll put things in it like *everything we have to do* and code snippets, and links and stuff. Feel free to edit.

## To do

- [ ] Take two other data runs for R vs T
- [ ] Find an axplanation for systematic error in V vs T
- [ ] Take more measurements for uncertainties:
    - [ ] Cold temperature equilibrium (lots of liquid nitrogen)
    - [ ] Room temperature (in the thermos)
- [ ] Write methods and analysis for band gap
- [ ] Write methods and analysis for Hall coefficient
- [ ] Write methods and analysis for magnetoresistance
