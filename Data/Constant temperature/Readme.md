# Constant temperature

These measurements will be used to determine the uncertainty on the temperature.
They are a series of measurements taken at constant temperature.
There is one series for room temperature, and one for high temperature, with the sample at equilibrium.

*No current is ran in the sample during that time, because there is no need to.*
