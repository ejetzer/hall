    "> - Measure the magneto-resistance of the sample as a function of the magnetic field intensity;\n",

Make sure the nitrogen can evaporate from the thermos, otherwise the sample won't warm back up to room temperature in any reasonable time. You can do this by taking a paper towel to brush off the ice forming around the thermos. Use `hall` to check on the temperature. Once the temperature is stable, restart `hall` to get a data file with only the data we need. When the temperature reaches $250\\mathrm{K}$, turn on the heater with a low potential to help bring the sample up to $400\\mathrm{K}$. Raise the heater voltage if the temperature stabilizes again. Be careful to not let the sample heat up over $400\\mathrm{K}$, because the soldered connections could melt. Turn off the current source, thermocouple, multimeter and heater.\n",
