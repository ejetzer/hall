    "From the manual:\n",
    "> - Measure the resistivity of germanium as a function of temperature and deduce conclusions regarding the conduction mechanism;\n",
    "> - Measure the dependence of the Hall voltage across the sample on temperature;\n",
    "> - Measure the magneto-resistance of the sample as a function of the magnetic field intensity;\n",
    "> - **(optional)** Be creative! You may for instance study the dependence of the magneto-resistance effect on the orientation of the sample, study the heating rate of the sample, or do whatever else that may come to mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "I propose that the optional part be spent on measuring the heating rate of the sample, as it brings together the temperature and magnetism aspect of the experiment. Still two weeks to think about, though. No worries."

The sample is too fragile to be manipulated by our impure hands ;P We also **don't** need the dimensions for most of the experiment. To paraphrase Dominic: the dimensions of the sample are only useful to get the resistivity, carrier density or charge. We rarely need those, so whenever we can, we should use the **resistance** instead of the resistivity, to reduce our uncertainties in the other sections of the experiment. I'll check, but this may mean that we can **completely scrap this part of the experiment**."
